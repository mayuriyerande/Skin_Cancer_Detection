# Skin_Cancer_Detection

<h3>Introduction</h3>
One of the most quickly spreading diseases in the world is considered to be skin cancer. Skin cancer is a disease in which abnormal skin cells develop out of control. In order to determine potential cancer therapies, early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential. The visibility of the skin diseases increases the chances of early detection and diagnosis.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
In the existing systems, The lesion image analysis tool checks the skin cancer parameters.The extracted feature parameters classify the image as normal skin and cancer lesion. The Detection of melanoma for the existing systems is not always accurate. 
With our project, we aim to increase the accuracy of detection of melanoma and make it efficient for the users so they can rely on this skin cancer detection system. 

<h3>About Dataset</h3>
Our dataset was hosted by International skin imaging collaboration. Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images. More than 50 percent of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), confirmation by invivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion id-column within the HAM10000 metadata file.
